🔁 Currently rebuilding legacy school projects to modern, scalable apps  
📚 Exploring Clean Architecture, CQRS, Domain-Driven Design & more  
🎯 On a mission to grow into a solid medior fullstack developer  

## 🧰 Modern Focused Tech Stack

### To-Do
Currently relocating old legacy projects into this fresh github repository. Now that I am graduated and I have some extra free time, I will have a look to modernize my old legacy projects who will be among my current public repo's. My legacy projects are prefixed with '--Legacy--'. The goal is to recreate projects that i have implemented some years ago into a fresh repository with a modern technology stack and deeper knowledge of actual solution architecture, design patterns and software design.
